Powershell Web Service with CAS Authentication

Use the built in Windows Web Service manager (http.sys) to create services written in pure Powershell. The CasClient module, also written in Powershell, enables CAS authentication of user requests. With support for simple forms, this allows users to remotely request (with authentication and access control) packaged administrative operations that run on a Server under a userid with higher privileges.
